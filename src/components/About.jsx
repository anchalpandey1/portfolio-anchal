    <p className='text-xl mt-20'>Hey there! I'm a pre final year computer science student who loves to 
    explore new technologies and write about them. I've got a good handle on web and Python development,
     and I'm currently working on some exciting projects with the React. When I'm not tinkering with code,
      I'm busy to learn technical terms that are organized, innovative, and easy to understand.
       I also freelance on the side. I'm excited to continue developing my 
    skills and abilities in the field, and I'm always on the lookout for new challenges to tackle.
